# Basic Approach

When 3 main problems of React at that time became obvious to Facebook team, they decided to take the next steps:

‚ùå Move away from classes  
‚úÖ Write declarative code  
üåä Do not introduce breaking changes  

Alongside that concept, React team introduced **3 main rules** of writing and using hooks.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Only call hooks from a top level,** which means never calling a hook inside conditional statements or loops.
|

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Only call hooks inside React functions,** which means that you cannot use this API anywhere outside components.


3Ô∏è‚É£ **ALWAYS call your custom hooks starting from the "use" keyword.** This naming convention helps React to identify hooks and allows you to use other hooks inside your custom hook. It also helps visually separate hook-based logic from everything else.
