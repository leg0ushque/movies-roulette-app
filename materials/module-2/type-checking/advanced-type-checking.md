# Advanced Type Checking

So once you decide that prop types is not enough for you, you might go to TypeScript or Flow. Lets have a look at them.

| Feature                  | TypeScript                                        | Flow                           |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| Community & Popularity   | Highly popular, widely adopted                    | Less popular than TypeScript   |
| Ecosystem & Tool Support | Extensive tooling, libraries, and IDE support     | Good support in IDEs and tools |
| Type Inference           | Powerful type inference capabilities              | Capable type inference         |
| Language Compatibility   | Express, React, Vue, Angular etc.                 | React only                     |
| Configuration            | Requires configuration (tsconfig.json)            | Minimal configuration needed   |
| Learning Curve           | Steeper due to language complexities              | Relatively easier to learn     |
| Compiler                 | Compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript            | Only checks, doesn't compile   |
| Null Safety              | Supports optional chaining and nullish coalescing | Supports optional types        |
| Documentation            | Comprehensive and extensive documentation         | Sufficient documentation       |

As you can see we have a table with the details of it.
No matter which IDE or code editor, it will have TypeScript support.
Flow has limited support.
If you have any question regarding TypeScript, you might use Stack Overflow.
We have many benefits for TypeScript, like library support, autocomplete, compiler error detection.
For TypeScript you might go away from React, and can use Vue, Angular, Express application with TypeScript, when Flow you can use only for React application.
Also, TypeScript is used for Flow.
One day, when Flow will be no longer maintained, and TypeScript will have a better future.
