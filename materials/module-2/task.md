## Task #1 Description

In this task, you will create a React **Class** component that render an input, "add" button and list of items from props.
Save items from props to the state. Follow the props and state interface.
You will use a mock array of data provided in the template to build your component.

:::note
In this task, class components are used solely to help you understand how they work.
While it's important to be familiar with them, class components are considered an outdated approach in modern React development.
Always use functional components in real-world projects unless there is a specific reason not to.
