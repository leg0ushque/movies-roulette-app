# Prerequisites

Before you start, here are a few things you need to know. Since React is a JavaScript library, you should be familiar with HTML and JavaScript.
We will commonly use JavaScript ES6+ features in this program, so please refresh you knowledge on the following concepts if you haven't already:

- ES6 classes
- Arrow functions
- Let/const
- Template strings
- Spread/Rest operators
- Destructuring
- Map, Reduce and Filter
- Ternary operator
- Import and Export statements
- Promises
- Async Functions
- Default parameters etc

Additionally, you will need a package manager like NPM or YARN to install React and related libraries.
