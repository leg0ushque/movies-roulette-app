**Here you can find requirements to all components that you need to create in the scope of FINAL TASK**

:::info
You DO NOT HAVE TO create the following components, just modify existing one that you have in the template.
:::

## Init Preparation
1. Check if you have a forked template `rgp-final-task-template` in the [autocode.git.epam.com](https://autocode.git.epam.com/)
2. Clone the template repo and install dependencies
```npm
npm install
```
3. Run the application
```
npm run dev
```
4. Look through the project structure in the template:
```
|--src
  |
  |--common
  |  |--Button
  |  |--Modal
  |  |--Input
  |  |--PrivateRoute
  |
  |--components
  |  |--forms
  |  |  |--MovieForm
  |  |  |--UserForm
  |  |
  |  |--Header
  |  |
  |  |--MovieDetails
  |  |--MoviesList
  |  |  |--MovieTile
  |  |
  |  |--Panel
  |
  |--store
  |
  |--types
  |
  |--services
     |--createUser.ts
 ```

Below tou can find detailed description and requirements for each component.

:::warning
Since this task will be checked by Autocode you should follow next rules:
* keep the structure that we provided in the template
* do not install any additional dependencies
* do not commit with linter warnings and errors
:::

5. Clone [repo with backend](https://autocode.git.epam.com/ld-autocode-js-programs/react-global-program/api-react-global) and follow `README.md` instructions.


## Store
Template path:
```
src/store/index.ts
```
We are using `Redux Toolkit` and `Redux Thunk` for this application.  
1. Configure a store and connect it to the application by covering `App` component with `Provider` in the `main.ts` [example link](/module-5/redux-toolkit#simplified-store-setup);
2. Create `moviesSlice` and `userSlice` in the appropriate files:
   * `src/store/moviesSlice.ts`
   * `src/store/userSlice.ts`
   See [Create Slices topic](/module-5/redux-toolkit#creating-slices)
3. Create SELECTORS (`src/store/selectors.ts`):
   * `selectMovies` - return movies list to display in MoviesList
   Please, feel free to create any additional selectors you want.
4. Create THUNKS (`src/store/thunks.ts`):
    * `fetchMoviesThunk`
    * `addMovieThunk`
    * `updateMovieThunk`
    * `deleteMovieThunk`
    * `loginUserThunk`  
    * `getUserThunk`  
  See [Async Operation with createAsyncThunk topic.](/module-5/redux-toolkit#async-operations-with-createasyncthunk)  
  Please, feel free to create any additional thunks you want.
5. Find hooks in the `src/store/hooks`:
    * useAppSelector: [use instead of `useSelector`](/module-5/react-redux);
    * useAppDispatch: [use instead of `useDispatch`](/module-5/react-redux).

## Routing
Add Routing to your application
1. [Set Up the Routes Component](/module-4/react-router-basics#creating-basic-routes)
  To enable routing in your application, wrap it with the `Routes` component. This component will handle the definition of paths and the rendering of corresponding components based on the current route.

2. Define Routes
   Add the following routes to your application:

| Route                   | Components Rendered                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/` and `/movies`       | Render the `MoviesList` component.                                                 |
| `/movies/:movieId`      | Render the `MovieDetails` component alongside the `MoviesList` component.          |
| `/movies/add`           | Render the `MoviesList` component and a required `Modal` containing the `MovieForm` component in 'ADD' mode ONLY for admin user. |
| `/movies/edit/:movieId` | Render the `MoviesList` component and a required `Modal` containing the `MovieForm` component in 'EDIT' mode INLY for admin user. |
| `/login`                | Render the `UserForm` component in Login mode. |
| `/registration`         | Render the `UserForm` component in Registration mode. |


3. Use the Modal Component
   For routes like `/movies/add`, `/movies/edit/:movieId` and `/movies/:movieId` the `Modal` component is required to wrap.

## User Types
* non authorized user: show only Login and Registration pages;
* authorized users: show movies with Search, filters, sort option, Login and Registration pages;
* ADMIN user: all pages are available. This user is able to delete, add and edit movies.

## Admin Credentials
We have already created an ADMIN user, please use these credentials to login as ADMIN.  
Email: 
```
admin@email.com
```
Password:
```
Admin123
```

## Styling
To add a creative touch to this task, the component styling is entirely up to you. While we have provided some initial styles in the `styles.module.scss` files for the components, you are free to use, modify, or remove them as you see fit. The only requirement is to ensure that all page elements are positioned according to the provided design specifications.

---

## App
This is a main component in your application. 

**Contains:**
  * `Routers` component with `Route`s components.

**Functional requirements:**
  * Get user info if `token` is present in the `localStorage`:
    * Put user token to the store (`state.user.token`);
    * Use `getUserThunk` to get user info by [GET] `/me/user` API.
  * Get movies list by [GET] `/movies` API and put data to the store (`state.movies.fetchedMovies`):
    * Use `fetchMoviesThunk`.

App component should be wrapped in `Provider` in the `src/main.ts`.


## Private route

**Use this component to render `MovieForm` component by routes `/movies/add` and `movies/edit/:movieId`.**

Path: 
```
src/common/PrivateRoute/PrivateRoute.tsx
```

**Props:**
  * `children` - any private component.

**Functional requirements:**
  * should render any component as a children;
  * checks user's role (store.user.role) and if it is admin returns component as children otherwise redirects to `/movies`.

## Button

Find the `Button` component at the following path:
```
src/common/Button/Button.tsx
```

Enhance the existing component to meet the specified requirements.

**The `Button` component is a functional component that renders a `button` HTML element.**

**Props:**
- `children`: Accepts any content to be displayed inside the button.
- `onClick`: A callback function executed when the button is clicked.

**Additional Notes:**
- Feel free to add any additional props as needed to enhance functionality.
- Reuse the `Button` component across all components where buttons are required in the design.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Ensure consistency by using the `Button` component wherever a button is present in the application design.

Please, feel free to add any props you need.

___

## Input
Find the `Input` component at the following path:
```
src/common/Input/Input.tsx
```

Enhance the existing component to meet the specified requirements.


**Contains:**
  * `input` tag;
  * `label` tag.

:::note
Using a `label` tag for `input` is considered good practice.
[Usage and benefits of label tag.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp)
:::

**Props**:
  * `placeholderText` - to provide placeholder text for input field;
  * `onChange` - pass a callback function that will be executed upon a field content is changed;
  * `labelText` - text for input label to describe the input's purpose ;
  * `value` - pass the value for input field;

Please, feel free to add any props you need.

## MoviesList
![](images/movies-list.jpg)

Template path:
```
src/components/MoviesList/MovieList.jsx
```
[Figma link.](https://www.figma.com/design/fKGjrOqR6nJe6LYJopGCZ8/%5BCDP%5D-Home-Task-%E2%80%93-React-v1?node-id=0-2&t=lfXtXgfBwBXDrN0r-0)

**Use this component to render the list of [`MovieTile` component](/HT/description-and-criteria#movietile).**

**Contains:**
  * Movies count information (number 4 in Figma);
  * `Panel` component;
  * List of `MovieTile` components.

**Functional requirements**
* Render component in `App` component by routes `/` and `/movies`;
* Fetch movies list: use `fetchMovies` thunk to fetch movies (`http://localhost:4000/movies`);
* Show a message "Loading movies..." instead of movies list while fetching;
* Show a message `Error: {fetch error}` instead of movies list if fetch is not success;
* Use `useAppDispatch` to put movies list to the store;
* Use `useAppSelector` and `selectMovies` selector to get movies list from store;
* Use `useSearchParams` react-router-dom hook to get `search`, `filter` and `sort` queries.


:::tip
For draft development you can use mocked movie list data, find these data in the `src/moviesMock.js`.

Use loop for `MovieTile` rendering.

Please, follow [this link](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists) to the **"Rendering Lists"** topic to see the example.

## How to finish task and get a grade?

When you finish all tasks and your app follows all criteria you can test your app locally before pushing your changes to Autocode.

You can use the command below for a local test run. Tests will run in "watch" mode so that each code change will restart tests.
```http request
npm run test:local:final
```
Also, you can look at tests implementation for solving troubles in your code.

Tests for the current module are stored in the folder - `__/src/__tests__`

It is not necessary to check this part of App with Autocode. Please proceed with next state of final task.
